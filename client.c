	   although it turns out that the AEX seems always to return
	   all its data for each response in one shot, so this code
	   will work for now.

	   Reading the response is trivially more challenging than it
	   appears because the network client code needs to understand
	   a little bit about RTSP to know how much to read.

	   RFC2326, ยง9.2 Reliability and Acknowledgements

	   Unlike HTTP, an RTSP message MUST contain a Content-Length
	   header whenever that message contains a payload. Otherwise,
	   an RTSP packet is terminated with an empty line immediately
	   following the last message header.

	   The pseudocode is as follows:

	   Read a chunk of data from the socket.  Parse the received
	   data until you get '\n' which indicates the end of a
	   header.

	   If the line you just parsed is a Content-Length header,
	   record its value in a field in the response structure,
	   payload_length or something, else check to see if you just
	   read a blank line indicating the end of headers.  If you
	   read a blank line, you're done reading headers, so check to
	   see if there's a payload_length.  If there's a payload
	   length, try to read that much data from the socket, and
	   you're done.

	   The rest of the headers and payload will be parsed by the
	   caller.
